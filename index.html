		description: <br>
		All images have been created with the given prompt and expanded with the phrase "expand" by Gianluca Winter and the DALL-E Artificial Intelligence. One real-world copy was given to selected people as a Christmas present in 2022. Each copy consists of a double-sided image in an acrylic glass frame measuring 10x15cm.
		<br><br><br>
		To every picture, one "Basquiat-Pokemon" has been assigned, each and all with the recipients in mind. The name "Basquiat-Pokemon" refers to the phrase used to create the Pokemon-like characters: since DALL-E does not allow the creation of trademarked intellectual property, a loophole has been found by referring to the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, or more so telling the AI to appropriate his art style, which is possible. In a reverse manner, the output are new Pokemon how Basquiat could have created them. They all have their own type, which is given on the physical copy as well. The collection consists of the real-world copies and a website accessible through an individual QR code on the physical copy. Through this, the holder can get additional information about his artwork and the collection. The individual owners, all friends and family of the human co-creator, are therefore connected indirectly, socially and digitally.
		<br><br>
		<br><br>
		thoughts on the process:
		<br>
		The use of the DALL-E image creation was originally used to present the machine's visualization on an abstract thought articulated in words. The human co-creator wanted to visualize an overview on his curriculum of computer science classes and how they relate to each other. A process that structure thought and gives perspective.
		<br><br><br>
		The output was impressive due to its speed, but also its unexpected use of symbolism, colors and its going off-assignment and seemingly interpreting the prompt in its own way. It was quickly realized that the use of this generative AI allowed for a quick and scalable production of images. So the human co-creator focused on the curation and presentation of the work the AI has produced by printing the images and framing them in an acrylic glass frame that is presentable from two sides. Furthermore, they were assigned a unique Pokemon-like character and linked all together through a website accessed through QR codes on the physical copies.
		<br>
		The term "human co-creator" is used to emphasize the diminishing role the human has played in creating this. He cannot claim full credit, since although he came up with the initial prompt, he did not further contribute to the creation of the images.
		<br><br><br>
		The "Basquiat-Pokemon" characters and the art collection as a whole draw inspiration from the tradition of appropriation in art, exemplified by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol's collaboration in the 1980s. By using the "Basquiat hack" to appropriate Basquiat's art style and create new and unique artworks, the collection engages with themes and ideas that were important to both artists, such as the role of the artist in society, the use of popular culture in art, and the relationship between fine art and commercial art. The use of AI in creating the "Basquiat-Pokemon" characters adds a new dimension to the concept of appropriation and the mixing of styles, reflecting the way in which technology and culture are merging in the contemporary art world.
		<br><br><br>
		It appears that we are funneling culture into a single, ghost-like entity that comes to life through AI. In collaboration with this entity, the human-creator is able to tap into an endless supply of cultural ideas almost instantaneously, overcoming the constraints of their physical capabilities. By sharing credit with the Artificial Intelligence, an emphasis is put on the collaboration and dialogue involved in the process. The boundaries of creation and originality are also blurred in this process, as the AI appropriates the art style of Jean-Michel Basquiat to generate unique artworks that challenge traditional notions of authorship and originality.
